# Language Detection 

This repository contains code and resources for a language detection project based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The project aims to identify 18 different languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Bengali and more.

# Requirements:

* Python

* Scikit-learn

* TensorFlow

* Keras
 
* nltk

# Dataset:

The language detection models were trained on a dataset of text samples from various sources, such as Wikipedia articles, news articles, and social media posts. 

# Results:
The results of each model on the dataset are as follows:

|  Model | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 94.78% |
| Support Vector Machine | 95.98% |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | 97.61% |
| Randomforest Classifier| 91.48% |
| GradientBoostingClassifier | 88.03% |
| Ensemble Classifier | 96.93%% |
| AdaBoost | 84.48% |
| LSTM Model | 95.64% |
| GRU Model | 94.88% |
| CNN Model | 91.43% |
| Hybrid Model | 92.29% |
| DNN Model | 95.69% |
| BERT | 97.46% |
