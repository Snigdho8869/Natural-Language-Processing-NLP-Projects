# Text Summarization 

This project showcases a text summarization system that combines both abstractive and extractive summarization techniques using various pre-trained models. It is a versatile tool that can generate concise and coherent summaries from a wide range of input texts.

## Overview

- **Abstractive Summarization:** In this project, I employ abstractive summarization models such as BART, DistilBART, T5, PEGASUS, and ProphetNet to generate summaries. Each of these models provides a different approach to summarizing text.

- **Extractive Summarization:** I also implement extractive summarization techniques that identify and extract important sentences from the input text. This method helps maintain the original context and wording of the document.

- **Hybrid Summarization:** I combine the results of the abstractive and extractive approaches to produce a more comprehensive summary that retains the most critical information from the input.

- **Ensemble Summarization:** I take it a step further by combining the summaries generated by multiple abstractive summarization models to ensure diverse perspectives in the final summary.
