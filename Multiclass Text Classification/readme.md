# Multiclass Text Classification 

This repository contains code for implementing various machine learning and deep learning models for multiclass text classification. The models implemented in this repository include support vector machines(SVM), Multinominal naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forests, ensembled learning, adaboost, gradientboosting, Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) an Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU).

# Requirements:

* Python 

* Scikit-learn

* TensorFlow 

* Keras
