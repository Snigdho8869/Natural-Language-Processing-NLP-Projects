# Spam Detection 

This repository contains various machine learning models for spam detection, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, and Ensembled Learning. Additionally, it includes deep learning models such as LSTM, GRU, CNN and BERT. These models can be used for email or text-based spam detection in different applications.

# Features:

* Machine Learning models for spam detection

* Deep Learning models for spam detection

* Cross-validation for model evaluation

* Support for different data preprocessing techniques


# Usage:

# Training the Model

* Prepare the data by cleaning and preprocessing the text.

* Split the data into training and testing sets.

* Instantiate a model.

* Train the model using the training data.

* Evaluate the model using the testing data.

# Making Predictions

* Load the saved model.

* Preprocess the text to be predicted.

* Use the model to make predictions on the preprocessed text.
